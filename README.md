# Working with binary search trees

## Tree

Data structure that consist of nodes which are linked together in a certain way. Nodes in a tree have a parent-child relationship. Each node is linked to 0 or more child nodes and at most 1 parent. There is a special node at the top of the tree called the root node, from which all other nodes descend. The root has no parent. Nodes without any children are called leaf nodes.

## Binary Tree

 Tree with an additional limitation: each node can only have 0, 1, or 2 children (at most 2 children). A branch in a tree signifies a decision path, a choice that connects 1 node to another. 

## Binary Search Tree

 All of the nodes in the left-hand branch of a node are guaranteed to have lower values than the node itself, and all of the nodes in the right-hand branch of a node are guaranteed to have a higher value than the node itself.
